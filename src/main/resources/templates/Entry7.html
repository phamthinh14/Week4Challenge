<h2 class="IntroText">Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming with Java</h2>
<div class="container">
    <p class="jumbotron">Programs are made up of modules, which are parts of a program that can be coded and tested
        separately, and then assembled to form a complete program. In procedural languages (i.e. C) these modules are
        procedures, where a procedure is a sequence of statements. In C for example, procedures are a sequence of
        imperative statements, such as assignments, tests, loops and invocations of sub procedures. These procedures are
        functions, which map arguments to return statements.<br>


        The design method used in procedural programming is called Top Down Design. This is where you start with a
        problem (procedure) and then systematically break the problem down into sub problems (sub procedures). This is
        called functional decomposition, which continues until a sub problem is straightforward enough to be solved by
        the corresponding sub procedure. The difficulties with this type of programming, is that software maintenance
        can be difficult and time consuming. When changes are made to the main procedure (top), those changes can
        cascade to the sub procedures of main, and the sub-sub procedures and so on, where the change may impact all
        procedures in the pyramid.<br>


        One alternative to procedural programming is object oriented programming. Object oriented programming is meant
        to address the difficulties with procedural programming. In object oriented programming, the main modules in a
        program are classes, rather than procedures. The object-oriented approach lets you create classes and objects
        that model real world objects.
